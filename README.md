# Digikam Face Relations
This is a small (and poorly written) tool to view which are the most common faces in your pictures, and how often they appear together.

## Installation
[First of all, you need to install python.](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
Then upgrade **pip** and install the required packages:
```
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
You need to add your Digikam-Database path to the `.env` file `DATABASE_PATH = /path/to/your/database/digikam4.db`
